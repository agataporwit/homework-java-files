Assignment 6 part 1
Create an Employee class that stores an employeeâ€™s ID number and information about the employee.
Then create an EmployeeMap that allows you to add Employee objects and look them up by employee ID number.
The EmployeeMap class should use a Map object to map ID numbers to Employee objects. Create an application
to demonstrate the classes.
The employee information you store in the map must include employee name (first, last),
address (street address, city, state, zip), and hire date.
