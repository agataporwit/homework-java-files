 * @student Agata Jelen CSD 141 Fall 2018
 * 
 * Algorithm Notes: variables are declared with greatest being set to the absolute lowest 
 * int value (to ensure that any user number will be stored as the greatest as it will 
 * be greater than the lowest possible value), and smallest with the absolute 
 * greatest int. value to ensure user numbers will be smaller. 
 * Output for program instructions are displayed prior to 
 * requesting input from user. The user is prompted for 
 * integers with a try/catch statement in case they 
 * enter anything other than an integer. 
 * As the user enters integers, the numbers are converted and placed 
 * within a for loop for evaluation. A temporary variable stores the numbers 
 * that are neither the greatest and smallest and will compare the values of n(formatted user input) 
 * to decide which number provided was greatest or smallest. 
 * The calculation and evaluation does not include the sentinel value as the example
 * also did not use the value as part of the evaluation process.
